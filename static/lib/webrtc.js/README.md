# webrtc.js
 
A helper for creating and managing WebRTC connections in a cross-browser sort of way.

This is used in http://simplewebrtc.com which is what powers: https://talky.io

It's designed for use with browserify/CommonJS on the client. 

If you're not using browserify or you want AMD support use `webrtc.bundle.js`.


## Installing

```
npm install webrtc
```

## Caution

This is still a very much a work in progress and is currently only being used in one project (that will change soon). But until it's a bit more vetted, you've been warned.

Having said that, contributions/feedback welcomed :)
